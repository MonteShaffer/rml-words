The geography of Ancient America as well as a true understanding of their histories before and after the prophesized 1492 are essential to developing a healthier construct of reality.

The Arabian travels are all basically decided based on what Nephi shares, but the excitement and intrigue that he does not share are outlined in Isaiah (and likely fully explained by his father Lehi):  the arrows of Kedar, the rescue by Tayma with food/water, and the great escape with the Ark of the Covenant.  Great indeed are the words of Isaiah!  I would only add a few key elements, specifically the markers to the basic Arabian geography:  Shazer, Irreantum, and Bountiful.  Shazer is a Egyptian/Hebrew word meaning "garden of birth" [sha is garden in Egytian, zer is issue/seed/birth like Zerahemla].  April 5th-ish, a comet appears in the sky, the Liahona provides the impetus to get a pregnant women to journey a few short days to the location of Moses/Joshua's communications with God (the true Sinai).  Later, this same location would be where Jesus was transfigured and Mohammed would have his vision in the mountains.  A cross-roads of holiness which suggestions that Noah and Abraham would have also had spiritual experiences there.  The daughters of Joseph are going through the wall (Gen 49:22).  Maybe almond blossoms are falling or a late winter snow.  Maybe both.  A difficult birthing process with the umbilical cord twisting around Jacob's neck.  Yet he survives and the signs in the sky are a marker (the comet later named after Halley).  600 years after Jacob's birth, another birth would occur; the birth of Yeshua.  The 600 year prophecy.  And the 1500 year prophecy would follow about a Judean among the Gentiles that would arrive and bring death and destruction, summarized by one word:  Colon-mbia.  Did Nephi remove this as a teaching tool "fill in the blank"?  Or did scribal filtering remove this because it was too blatant and obvious a prophecy?

Irreantum is a Tamil word describe the red bloom of algae that can live in both salt and fresh water.  The trade route by water between India and Egypt was well established.  Irreantum was originally bastardized by early German map makers and a region near the dangerous gulf of Aden is today called Eritrea.  The label may have been a naming convention used by sailors to describe regions as it would appear arriving by boat from a specific direction (from the east as the likely default).  Ir means city, re-ee may mean ridge than water, and antium may mean port, specifically a foreign port.  Traveling from India toward Egypt, you will see a city, than a ridge, than water, than you will arrive at the port.  Now apply this to other words prevalent in South America:  Parana, Iguazu, Ituzaingo as travel markers.  Other names were functional markers to distinguish the locations contribution to the greater society:  Arikat, Aripuana, Ariquelmes, Ariquipa.  Based on access to iron ore, the name for the land and city of Bountiful in the local language was likely Khori-Khori (likely why Korihor was named thus).  Bountiful does not mean bounteous.  It means a land of liberty and freedom, a different form of society than Lehi had experienced in his lifetime.  Shown to Nephi in his youth so he could understand some of the primary principles and adopt them when society flourished when the people of Nephi became servant leaders of the many distinct local tribes they encountered.  Laman went the traditional route, using fear/power to exploit the weak.  A cronista curator described the arrival of two brothers by boat as the Tupi-Guarani with the locals saying the name of their God was Tupa.  If Nephi is the good guy, the man of God, it is not difficult to isolate which brother carried which name.  Was this an initial name or a name after the Yeshua visit?  Tupa is a God of thunder and lightning like Thor in Viking tradition and like Jehovah in Canaanite tradition.  The choice of this name fascinates me.

They traveled south, stopping for water on an island today called Comores that has a river called Moroni.  Supposed the word Moroni means river or at the river in the local language.  Oddly, this same stem "Moron" means river in the Mongolian language.  I would estimate after the departure, the arrival to an island to find fresh water is when the brothers opened some honey wine to celebrate that this crazy idea of their brothers would actually work.  The shunting of the boat suggests the type of sale and the novelty was likely a trimaran similar to the Fijian Drua.  So they arrived at about 30 degrees south on a western shore.  That was likely the clue Joseph Smith was given, he equated that with his personal studies with a dear friend (Frederick Granger Williams) as Valparaiso Chile.  If the Atlantic was transversed, it would minimize the miles traveled.  They could hug the African coast until traveling to Gough Islands (where Napoleon was later exiled).  The season winds would bring them up the eastern coast of Brasil.  Likely they landed at a mbya in Brasil.  Then they found an opening that God provided (para - ana) that was as wide as an ocean but containing fresh water.  Unlike today, they didn't name subrivers, everything would be stems of the Parana as the Nile was refered in Ancient Egypt.  In the Rosario area of Argentina (Parana river near Esquina) on the western shore of the river, they likely first disembarked on the shore (or more likely on a river island).  Later the many other rivers would be discovered and the lands of first arrival would become Nephi's first inheritance, named Uruguay as uru-gua-ee the pure big waters.  Jacob and Joseph were likely given Paraguay as para-gua-ee the opening of big water (Corrientes northward, maybe also Salta westward).  Lehi likely saw the waterfalls of Bountiful (Saulala) and the great falls of Iguazu and Guiara as a fulfillment of his spiritual name lia-a-a-ee. A play on words to the way to the river islands (Isaiah reference again).  Lehi's inheritance was Guiara (north) and his first-born was given Guarani (eastward Laman the son of Laman).  When Nephi separated himself from Laman, he left the river shed of the Parana and entered into the watershed in today's parlance labeled Amazon, but likely was Moroni or something like that.  Moroni means "bitter way" but also means "captain of the navy".  The fundamental flaw of all geographic speculations is the lack of understanding of the importance of Nephi's first innovation even though Mormon makes it very clear that shipping was a key capability of their society.  And tall strong soldiers.  And swords.  And swords beat into ploughshares to create mounds and earthworks.  

The separation required loading the valuables onto the original ship (even though they likely had built others) and sale north to the highlands of Paraguay, abandon the ship, travel on foot a short distance, and create an initial community in Rhodonia.  Jacob/Joseph would establish villages further west into Bolivia on the rivers.  Zoram would establish a center for trade on the river island called Santarem today.  Salt would be harvested from the island and eventually be traded to other communities thousands of miles away.  Traveling for the city of Zoram to Zarahemla [hundreds of years later] would take about 20 days.  Out the mouth of the Amazon, resupplying in Manti (the tip of the Yucatan or the island Colon initially discovered, like the first).  And Zarahemla would be exactly where Joseph described, across from Nauvoo.  That rivers system would be called Sidon (the entire system of the Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, and so on). 

Nephi would build fortifications and his lands in the Tocatins, so he could keep an eye on his brothers and protect as many innocent tribes as he could.  He was the father of cunadismo fathering children from every village to unify the tribes into a large family, the people of Nephi.  Jacob was the one emphasizing the preservation of the pure blood line (likely based on his personal understanding of his job).  Likewise, Nephi saw that he was the father of many peoples, likely of all skin colors.  So when Nephi dies, Jacob gives a speech, "don't do what my brother did"!

The waters of Mormon and the city of Noah was in the highlands connecting the Amapu area of the Amazon with the Guiana areas of the northern river systems with the primary river named Moroni today.  Where the Moroni entered the Caribbean, there was likely an island named Moroni there.  A city or land of Moronihah would mean it was like the city of Moroni but in the land northward.  The city of Noah was equated with El Dorado, the city of gold.  This is where lamanite kings established themselves because the soils were much richer than the fluvial amazon soils.  Cuba, Puerto Rico, Northern Florida (Coco beach), and Myrtle Beach were likely the Eastern shores captured by the lamanites in the wars described in Alma.  They could not enter the entry points of the river Sidon in the "Gulf of Mexico" so they would land on the eastern seaboard and try to cross territory on land.  The temple of Bountiful was the Serpent Earth Work in Ohio.  The Hopi are the anti-war peoples of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  The narrow neck of land separating the lands north/south is the Darian gap.  Obvious.  Trade across oceans occurred near Boquete, Panama.  Travel to Tonga and Hawaii occurred at some point, as did travel to the Columbia River basin by the "Sahaptin"... the story of Hagoth is not this.  These peoples merely traveled northward up to Minnesota or the Missouri to the land of ten thousand lakes (Minnesota / North Dakota).  When Colon first arrived he was attacked and defeated by a naval force.  On his return, he could not find it.  They likely understood that "Colon-mbia" and took off northward to escape the prophesied holocaust.

The temple of Jehovah that builded Nephi was likely in the Rhodonia's on a large plateau landscape.  Jacob/Joseph had smaller centers of workship on the rivers heading into Bolivia.  The name on the map is literally "X marks the spot" if you study a few Egyptian words:  "Uru Ea Wau Wau" which may translate as "purity holiness great great God".  As the civilization prospered, additional Great Works were created following the records of Joseph from Egypt who had the title of Ari-Kat.  The Easter Island Wall, the gates of Titicaca were an innovative brick devised out of a geopolymer:  ash from burning date palms and waterglass (a natural occurring silicate).  This was the same technology to build bricks to build the Steppe and Great pyramids.  Likely the Olmec heads and the Mayan temple structures were also built from this specialized brick that appears to be stone.

Did Nephi return to Africa, Bountiful, or even explore India in his lifetime?  We do not know this.  Did he bring others from these distant lands?  We do not know this.  Did he people try and explore the seas?  Certainly that is the case.  Did they adventure eastward toward Scandinavia/Europe (were they the Vikings/Anglo-Saxons/Franks)?  We don't know this.  But such a robust civilization would disrupt many modern taxonomies because all of them assume that trans-oceanic travel was not possible.  The Persian walnut taken to America by Mulek and the Phoenicians as the Black Walnut later taken to England by other expores becoming the English Walnut.  That is very plausible but completely unreasonable in the current academic echo chambers.  We can transplant such plants today, but anciently that did not happen.  Corn, potatoes, sugarcane is all fiction.  The date palm, the jaguar, and black tribes in America before "Amistad" all need to be reconsidered.  The true knowledge of Ancient America will become the tipping point that causes the modern house of cards to collapse.  The old FAKE NEWS will melt away and the new discoveries will accelerate innovation and human collaboration.  

And when people decide that economies can be abundant and that Nephi demonstrated how a society could feed and house and protect everyone first and foremost.  Then and only then can we work together and in a short amount of time restructure society.  The actions are obvious if you can see the picture.   Study what Nephi did and execute it in our world.  Feed/House/Protect everyone, create a land of milk and honey where one can procure wine without money.  Isaiah is amazing!  As was, and is, the legend that is Nephi.
