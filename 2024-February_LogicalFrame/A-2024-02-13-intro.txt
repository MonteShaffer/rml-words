Hello dear reader,

I am inviting you to join me on an adventure of discovery.  This is my personal journey of self-reflection, introspection, and observation.  Yet, I hope, it may also benefit you.

So who am I?  [Don't you see how many ways one could introduce themselves, and if my goal was to persuade a specific audience in this current world sytem, how I introduce myself will alter everything.  Luckily, I have transcended such barriers, and will try to introduce myself in a way that will make the logic of the discovery flow best.]

I was born on March 23, 1973 (Gregorian American Calendar) at approximately 7:12 AM in a small hospital in the town of Whitefish, Montana near Glacier National Park.  I was likely conceived the year before, July 4 weekend, on the land where I consider myself to have been born and raised.

I was my mother's fifth living child, my siblings being only a few years older than me: 4 1/2 (brother), 3 1/2 (sister), 2 (sister), 1 (sister).  I was my father's seventh living child, these siblings being born on the same date due to scheduled C-section deliveries were a bit older:  7 (brother), 6 (sister).

My father was born in Great Falls Montana, but moved to Utah when he was 5 (and his father had joined the Mormon Church).  My mother was born in SLC to a mother a faithful Catholic until the day she died.  My mother joined the Mormon Church when uniting with my father in co-creating a family.  There was some mystery surrounding my mother's father that was resolved after my grandmother died and before my mother died. 

Eventually, my mother had eleven living children, the youngest being the first C-section do to the onset of gestational diabetes, a brother about 12 years younger than me.  One of my younger sisters died in a house fire on March 1, 1977 just before my fourth birthday.  Most of us were at a Mormon primary activity (mid-week) at the local church.  My little sister was upstairs taking a nap, and died of smoke inhalation.  A 5-year old neighbor boy (parents have conflicting work schedules so the boy would stay at our home for a few hours most days) reportedly started the house on fire.  He also died, succumbing to the flames.  My mother was 28 years old, preparing to bury her sixth child.

I received a normal small-town American education for the era.  And I excelled scholastically.  Objective data says I was average until about third grade, and then things changed.  Some teachers saw I was gifted and tried to adapt to help me advance; others did not.  I had many opportunities to play in sports in my youth where intellect was a primary asset (before puberty and big muscles were required).

I was raised in the rural Mormon heritage.  We went to a small church that the local members built with their bare hands, had services in the morning and evening on Sundays, and had some mid-week activities as well.

My scholastic achievements were often a function of my own interests and motivations.  Many times a teacher would give me an A+ or A++ for the extension of an assignment into a new domain.  Other teachers would give me an A- for a similar effort as it did not follow the specific guidelines assigned.  That is, some teachers let me fly while others tried to teach me to stay in the cage.

The modern world, in retrospection may try to place labels on my personality.  Autism seems to be the buzz word.  Well, I had about 1/20th the aluminum in the "mandatory" vaccinations as a newborn compared to my son Alexander some 42 years later, so comparably, I am not as susceptible to such human manipulations; however, it is clear that I am an outlier in the domain of humanity.

If interested in a topic, I can easily focus and perform at a high level, about the 95th percentile in whatever I do.  Using objective tools of standardized testing, I am an outlier.  

10th grade Iowa Basics Test:  99th percentile on all subjects with a reading level of 13.5 grade (college) [99th as a percentile is debated in statistics to mean you are in the top bucket or there is 1% higher than you.]
Prelimary SAT:  99th percentile, scoring in the top 50,000 Americans that took the test that year [CR as well]
ACT:  30/33 (first/second attempts) in Spring/Fall 1990.  The second score made me eligible to apply for an ELITE scholarship at BYU given to only 24 persons.  I, however, missed the deadline for that process not realizing the necessity.
GMAT:  720 (2003-ish, no preparation scoring ironically lower in mathematics than language) - this score made me immediately eligible for the Mensa association.  Among test takers, 97th percentile.
LSAT:  158 (2003-ish, about a week of preparation, traveled to CA to take the test).  Amonth test takers, 80th percentile.

So dear reader, I believe I have established that I do have an objective level of intelligence.  As you read on, you will learn however, that at times it seems "I am the dumbest smart person" [Will Smith, I Robot].  [https://geediting.com/subtle-signs-someone-has-extremely-high-intelligence-even-if-they-downplay-it/].  Personally, I think the heavens are seeking intelligent life on this planet and cannot find it.  So I better keep learning!

So next, I will share my story of milestones in this lifetime.  Some may say these are achievements.  Many of them I personally saw as an "Opus" at the time I was doing them.

- Losing the 5th/6th grade spelling bee as a 5th grader by spelling correctly the wrong word [Roy Wendt:  intelligent or intelligency]
- Winning the 5th/6th grade spelling bee as a 6th grader but losing the multi-school valley competition by correctly spelling the wrong word [reality vs realty].
- Winning the school Knights of Columbus free-throw contest of my age group (basketball).
- Winning Babe Ruth State Championship as a utility player twice (13 and 15 years old).
- Working at Eddie's Cafe in Glacier National Park.  Later in life, consulting with the owners in an effort to sell it (and barely passing the realty exam to make certain the finder's fee was legal; a seasonal fire may have been the reason the primary potential buyer did not proceed).
- Winning awards in the classroom for being the fastest at math games/worksheets, reading the most on my free time (including twist-a-plot novels), and being asked to do extra work to contribute to classroom discuss (share with the class the Biblical Jonah story in English class as we studied Moby Dick)
- Participated in Chess Club in Junior High (Vinson was the teacher of Greek roots), was mediocre.  Continued to play in high school, improved to be the best (remaining) player.  Today, I have an ELO of about 2000 (5+5, 10+10 games).

- Being one of the first members of the school's "Academic Hall of Fame" in high school graduating with a 4.0 GPA (before AP classes inflated the measurement and using only semester values so an A- on the final transcript may have become an A).
- Receiving a Trustee scholarship to BYU (full tuition, not including room/board/books).  Receiving a few local scholarships, and offered a 50% tuition reduction scholarship to attend George Washington University.
- Taking the core classes as a freshman.  Moved from Calculus I to Calculus II Honors between semesters based on my scores.  Took Honors English with several students that were awarded the ELITE scholarship which paid for housing, food, and books.  Took American Heritage from Noel Reynolds.  Took Book of Mormon 121 from Reed Benson (his father was the President of the Church at the time).  Took Physics I/II.
- Serving a mission for the Mormon Church to Argentina (Resistencia mission, most of mission living in the province of Misiones, mostly in the Obera area).  Based on metrics of baptisms, was one of the top performers of my era.
- Finished my undergrad with minors in Spanish/Physics Teaching and a degree in Mathematics (Education flavor).  Was a student teacher while finishing school.  1991 High School graduate.  1997 College graduate with two-year mission hiatus and one-year student-teaching requirement.  Earned 168 undergrad credits.
- Worked on two papers that personally interested me:  "The Age of the Earth (religious)" and "The American Holocaust (historical study of the colonization of Ancient America)".  Also "helped" my older brother with his Senior Thesis for his undergrad in American History on Charles Julius Guiteau.
- Taught part-time at American Heritage School while completing my undergraduate degree.
- Did my student teaching at American Fork High School.  Then taught 2 1/2 years at Lone Peak High School (Geometry, Algebra 2, and Internet Communications [Programming]).  Elective points, Quotes of the Day, Pi Day, Lunchtime Chess, Boardwork, Persian Rug, Chaos Theory Jurrassic flavored.
- Moved to Carmel/Monterey California and worked at a boutique web-application company.  Developed a survey tool to assess aircraft safety in partnership with an academic at the NPS and implemented for USMC/ERAU and others.

- Implemented a second iteration of an online typing test with custom PDF certificates.
- Received a Dean's scholarship for first year of MBA at BYU based on GMAT scores.  Besides regular coursework (bouncing cranberries), worked on a business plan for CAHSEE, volunteered to help a professor develop an online personal-finance website and developed a javascript calculator that would compute all possible TVM calculations.
- Did market research for BYUTV, Chiquita Bites, and met with Little Giant Ladders to understand their operations.
- Audited courses in Econometrics (James MacDonald), Math Learning, Instructional Design, Principles of Learning (Dillion Inoye) to consider opportunities for continuing my education and seeking a Ph.D.
- Began a Ph.D. in Marketing at Washington State University in Pullman.  Finished the degree with a concurrent M.S. in Statistics.  "Helped" youngest brother execute research for his Master's project.
- Helped peers in Finance, Marketing, Information Systems with data collection or programming to complete their own dissertations.
- Published a paper with a mentor based on research collected in an undergraduate Marketing Research course (CFC and diet/exercise)
- Published Master's thesis comparing growth of Apples at different locations in Eastern Washington.

- Did a postdoc at the University of Arizona to standardize patent data and make more accessible to researchers by placing in a relational database system.
- Working with research assistant, developed other methods of measuring a multi-class network (other than the eigenvector methods developed for my dissertation).
- Worked with Mathematicians and the University of Padua to help compute my dissertation data, and develop a multi-class model.  Met with them in person to discuss potential and future directions.
- Moved to Lexington, KY when awarded the first NSF grant to commercialize PatentRank, an objective measure of a patent's intrinsic value.  Hired and trained programmers to help cleanse and organize patent data.  In 9 months, was able to OCR over 100 million patent-document pages and developed an archive product to sell to university libraries in partnership with Mergent.
- Developed other research streams, wrote several grants in various domains where the multi-class eigenvector system could help (e.g., DOD RIF on identifying bioweapons about four years before COVID).
- Developed a minimal-viable product for Patent Rank.  Did not receive funding for Phase II.
- Was awarded a second NSF grant to answer the question "Is My Idea Patentable?"  Taking information learned at a previous consulting job, I developed a unique method to do document correlations and concept searching.  Kentucky did not provide matching funds and Phase II funding was not awarded.  A minimal-viable product was created with a custom login system using SJCL and 2FA (a fort-knox login methodology).
- Attended local inventor workshops and helped several friends do research on their idea in context of existing patents.  Helped one friend write an NSF grant to use basic technologies to automate physical therapy routines to help persons with Parkinson's Disease.  Grant was awarded and helped develop the electronics, embedded C programming, and applications to interface with the electronics.  Kentucky matched the initial award with funding, but Phase II funding was not awarded by the NSF.

The final variable for this introduction would be the specific motivation of this endeavor.  As outlined above, I have a unique ability to use my intellect (maybe engineering mind) to design solutions to solve problems.  And although I did not find commercial success, I was successful many times of developing effective solutions.

Several times in my life, I had the impression that I was supposed to address the language issues with the official English edition of the Book of Mormon.  Having read the Spanish edition (which I later learned had many edits and editors), I understood that it was easier to understand the central message because the language was not masked with flowery Biblical rhetoric like the original English edition.  Could I write a simple version that would pass basic metrics of improved readability (e.g., Flesh-Kincaid Index) while maintaining the main thread of the content?

This ideas came to the fore-front again when dating Natalya (ethnic Russian) who was taking the Mormon discussions in Kazakshtan.  The missionaries gave her a Russian Book of Mormon that was nonsensical, so I encouraged her to take the discussions and read the book in English.  But some of the language was archaic, so she could not understand the central message.   So again, I began some efforts to try and translate/back-translate the beginnings of the Book of Mormon into a simple English/Russian/Spanish (with help from native speakers in Kazakshtan and Argentina).  

When Natalya's father died, October 2019, I was strongly compelled to attend to this idea with earnestness.  So for about four months, I worked on the first two books of the Book of Mormon, what I call the Legend of Nephi.  The 2020 edition is available for you to peruse if you wish.  I personally believe it was another Opus on my path of preparation.  I currently do not feel compelled to write an updated version (although I could and my worldviews have changed so the text would reflect those changes).  I do, however, recognize how that task opened up learning opportunities to study ancient languages (Hebrew, Egyptian, Guarani) and gain insights as I develop different thought experiments of potential scenarios in my efforts to seek additional light and knowledge promised to me.

So that is my goal.  To communicate and share some of the things I have learned so far.  And to make updates, as my understanding updates.

Whether you are ready to receive this gift is not my problem (Cual es su problema)?.  That is your choice.  And I have studied enough about psychology and marketing to understand that it will not be easy to accept this gift.  FNAF is the fundamental problem.

Cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable for many of us.  We want things to make sense.  We want everything to fit nicely together.  And in our upbringing, our society constructs a system that defines reality and truth.  My fundamental construction would be American-Judeo/Christian-Mormon.  

This is far from objective, but this is how human conditioning in this era currently works.  Some have significant life-altering events that opens up the possibility of some changes in perspective.  The Mormon Church understood this in the missionary efforts communicating in training materials that a divorce, a marriage, a death, a move, or some other life-altering event would make potential converts more likely to receive a new message.

We are comfortable when information fits nicely into our paradigms.  Likewise, inconsistent information makes us uncomfortable.  So if we discover something that enhances our current paradigm, it is so much easier to process and adopt.  If you follow this logic, this means we are often seeking only fragments of truth based on some personal biases.  We are inherently wanting a certain outcome.



Herein lies the problem.  Because one can only change so far.  Throwing the baby out with the bath water is very difficult to do.  So people have limits on accepting new ideas.  They need time to rebuild their mental constructs before being flooded with another challenge to their traditional views and perceptions.  The time of discomfort before updating the construct is called cognitive dissonance.  Humans want to minimize this.  It is in their nature.

FNAF defines the problem.  Fake News Abstraction Failure.  Now when I say "Fake News", you immediately think of Donald J. Trump.  For some of you, that motivates and for others, just the opposite.  Regardless of your opinion of Trump, this phrase has been embedded in our American Psyche.  Cognitive dissonance introduces you to the mental map that something is incongruent in your thinking; that is, it is fake news.  So you quickly try to reconcile the differences (to remove the discomfort) and update the mental maps accordingly.

But you are not considering the trends of the fake news and overall implications on the foundations of your constructed reality.  That is, if this element of a system is flawed, should I not reconsider the entire system and all of the elements?  But that can be both overwhelming and exhausting.  A nihilist may just conclude everything is broken.  An apologist may intentionally ignore facts that protect their current construction of reality.

The Abstraction Failure can be easily seen if one reads the romance novella "Flatland."  The Sphere convinces the Square of a new dimension, but the Square fails to convince the Sphere of the obvious pattern anchored to (n+1) induction.

So if I discover truths that violate the systems of American-Judeo/Christian-Mormon, what am I to do?  That is if I know that "Fake News" exists in some elements of each system, what can I do to develop a new, updated healthy mental map of reality?

This is nontrivial.  Therein lies the rub.  Once you get on the train of self-discovery, you have to review each train car.  You have to update your understanding of what each train car represents, what the train represents, and your destination.  This can be very difficult.

Esoterics are talking about the need for people to "wake up", embrace higher frequencies of love and joy, peace and harmony, collaboration and enlargement.  This may be congruent with Isaiah declaring that "scales will fall from our eyes" so we can see ourselves, our reality, and others as God sees us.  Makes me reflect on the words of the musical Les Miserable:  to love another human is to see the face of God!

So before I begin on the process or reconstructing mental systems, let me use an example that only a few will find immediately offensive.  

On Tuesday, 5 August 1600, James of Scotland visited the Ruthven lands and when he left, two brothers John and Alexander Ruthven were dead.  We can conclude those are facts, mostly because the two competing narratives agree on these elements.  When Queen Elizabeth dies in March 1603, James becomes King James of all of England.  James had court hearings in Scotland posthumously accusing the brothers of treason, drawing/quartering their remains, and not giving them respectful burials.  Several narratives were commissioned by James to communicate his perspective of the events.  "Rimur of Gowry" was an Icelandic poem that outlined the conspiracy/treachery of the Ruthvens against the honorable/just James.  One can read these things and say "oh good, a nice, informative history" or we can conclude that the propoganda is "Fake News".  

So how can we ascertain the truth with the evidence we are given?  It takes time and effort.  And we have to challenge our assumptions.  Certainly, I believe that I may be a great-grandson of Alexander, so I have a potentially-biased motivation to demonstrate an outcome.  Maybe I have rose-colored lenses and will not relent to being wrong.  It is human nature.  But my genetic ancestry, if it is authentic, may be motivating to help others not as interested see "the truth" if it can be demonstrated objectively.

Is my genetic ancestry authentic?  I had a genealogy file (PAF) and imported it into Legacy software in the early days of the technology (e.g., 2001).  Through a calculator, I may be a direct descendant of Alexander, who was nobility, so I now have a genealogy through Judeo/Christian tradition back to Adam.  If you look at modern resources, there is some dispute on even when Alexander was born.  Was it 1580 or 1582?  Either way, Alexander would have been physically capable of having a child.  When the Mormon Church bought familysearch and integrated the software algorithms, I was informed by the system (and some family members) that we are not relatives because the system concludes that 8 year olds do not get married, even among royalty.  And it was not possibly that he could have had an illigetimate child?!?  Can you see?  The system says based on an algorithm.  And therefore other nonsensical conclusions are added.  Whether intentional or not, a construction of truth says I am not a relative.  So my 30 years of personal study is WRONG, the computer said so.  Ridiculous!  Especially for me, someone that has written a bit of software and developed a few algorithms.

At the same time, the new Mormon familysearch system allow descendants to append photos and research to inform us about our potential ancestors.  In October 2019, a woman posted a book giving the Ruthven side of the story.  From their lens.  Back on the path of my motivation to define the TRUE narrative based on my foibles.  Again, we are at a stalemate, two competing stories exist.  So can we find a key performance indicator, a sufficient statistic.  Something that will enable us to arrive at a more informed conclusion.  So can I objectively process the two competition views and write a dialogue comparing the narratives (a la Galileo's treatiste Dialogue on the Two Systems).

The Ruthven version of the story shares that Alexander was a chamberman for James and Alexander's sister/cousin was a chambermaid for Queen Anne.  From this I can make certain reasonable conjectures as I can imagine a bunch of teenagers running around the castle.  Most teenagers have sex (Gordon's "stone-cold-sober research" backfire!).

Now Alexander/John unexpectedly leave and go to Padua Italy (at the time Galileo was alive there).  They write a letter to James asking "is everything cool between us" and on their return to England, visit (at her request) the Queen in London.  Queen Elizabeth gives them a formal escort to Ruthven lands in Scotland.  Was this escort a signal to Scotland of her choice, which the CABAL in Scotland (James sinod) did not like?

Six weeks later, the two brothers are dead.  Very recently, I learned another important data point.  The significance of the date 5 August to people living at that time.  That was the same date (in 1305) when The Bruce betrayed William Wallace.  The date when he was captured by the English and later hanged/drawn/quartered for treason.

So certainly, I can merge these additional facts and still develop competing narratives.  So let's continue our study by considering history and motivation.   The Ruthven family was gifted their lands by William Wallace after offering 500 men to battle with William.  The Ruthven Scottish crest was a ram and the family motto was "DEID SHAW" which may mean "DEED SHOW" as in "DO GOOD WORKS".  So more data to ponder.

On the fate of Alexander's death, James may have shown up to the castle with 500 horses and men.  The number 500, is this coincidence the same numbers?  

Regardless, the Ruthven lands had a church (of John the Baptist) and lots of people living on the lands.  The Ruthven narrative said they were told they had to leave by sundown OR ELSE.  After the death of the two brothers, the lands were confiscated by James.  

So I have to arrive at an intelligent conclusion.  Some may think it is conspiratorial and anchored to personal motivations.  Others that it is spot on regardless of a potential conflict of interest due to my possible (but certainly perceived) genetic connection.  But I have to take the data and make discernments.  So I need to include one more key data point.

Queen Anne and James were not having children. The first son Henry was removed from his mother's care at birth (because Queen Anne had Catholic tendencies but James' mother Bloody Mary was closely connected to the Catholic Rizzio while pregnant with James?!?), mysteriously died at the age of 18, "but we checked, it was not poison!"

You can analyze the potential ages of the different parties based on the current data we have.  Why would two brothers leave the inner circle of the castle, go to Italy, send a letter to James asking for peace, and then add this strange narrative about Henry.  So maybe Alexander or John were Henry's father.  So I have developed a testable hypothesis.  Even if you say it is a conspiracy theory!  The remains of the Ruthven brothers are not available to us, but certainly James/Anne/Henry are all buried in royal chambers.  A simple DNA test, maybe also with Charles.  And the evidence could objectively test this hypothesis.  

So I have some evidences, some potential personal biases, and can assign a probability to the events.  Maybe 90% chance that James was the bad guy.  Maybe this is not a dichotomous choice, maybe there are other options.  Maybe.  But if I try on the 90% hat, how will it inform my understanding of other information.  Should I not reconsider the narrative of the Rizzio conspiracy again alleging the Ruthven family was bad, when the father/grandfather were executed and had the family title (and accompanying income) stripped by the James family?  Of course I should.  And my world view of the British Empire will forever change.  Maybe Queen Elizabeth was communicating her Scottish choice (Ruthven) to succeed her.  Maybe.  What we do know is that William Shakespeare wrote Hamlet about 1603 and it was popularly successful in Germany.  He did not perform the play for James in London until 1619, the same year that Queen Anne died.

The James legacy of doing land grabs was ramped up when he commissioned the exploration vehicle Queen Elizabeth created (the East India Trading Company) to become an oppressor and exploiter of foreigners, their assets, and their lands.  Some estimate the pillage of the Indian subcontinent may exceed 20 trillion dollars of value.  The jewels on the British crown were taken from sacred Indian temples.  Plus the opium wars, the degradation of the traditional educational systems which distorted the beautiful society that was India before the British Empire. [Watch the movie RRR].

So if Alexander Ruthven had children, what was their legacy?  Nancy Trotter fled Ruthven lands to Ireland and eventually her ancestors went to American.  Two brothers (John Trotter) bought 5000 acres of land in the Paris, Kentucky area.  The local ancient American tribe asked these brothers (because of their integrity/honor as neighbors) to represent them and their interests in the negotiation and signing of a peace treaty with the federal government of the United States.  Likely, similar to the 100s or 1000s of other federal treaties, this agreement was not honored by the federal government.  This all leads to Mary Jane Lutz, a known relative of mine and likely having tribal ancestry in Ancient America.

If true, so what?  James was likely a bad man and killed good men.  This is nothing NEW in a study of human history, as we understand it.  

First, I believe it has value to recognize this moment as a potentially significant change point in the history of the world.  Where would the world be today if Queen Elizabeth in 1603 handed over the monarchy to a noble/honorable family?  We can't unring the bell, but our current American system is fundamentally an extension of the British colonial strategies implemented by James.  (One may even argue that America is still a vassal of the British Empire.  Another rabbit hole, not worth chasing at the moment.)  If I demonstrated that (1) the cabal exists, (2) the cabal engages in doing bad things, (3) the cabal kills good people, what advantage is there to outline every possible example.

Second, it puts you on a train of challenging the British system as established by James.  The King James Bible and the introduction of controlling information through the king's publishing house which led to copyright law and patent letters.  The British tradition of economics based on control, artificial scarcity, and inequity of the distribution of weath.  The banking systems that developed to benefit those in power to maintain their power and exploit those without power.

I personally can conclude that many American-Judeo/Christian-Mormon systems are all constructed around the James manifestation of the British Empire.

So now, let's back up.  Whatever interests you, you could likely do a deep dive and learn the constructs you have been trained to believe are likely all corrupted.  So can I believe anything?  If so, where can I begin.

Engineering often requires problem identification.  So if the objective is to build a new system of reality, you have to identify the problems of the old systems.  (1) Power seeks more power and preservation of existing power.  (2) Power is based on a zero-sum game, for those in power to win those NOT in power have to lose.  This inequity can be simply described by Isaiah as those "that grind the face of the poor."

So as a mathematician, can I take the inverses to restore equity and shift the reality.  (2') Power is a non-zero-sum game [everyone can win if the perceptions of the game are shifted, obviously triggered by groundswell.  (1')  Power is a function of meritocracy.  Those that give more and serve more earn more power.

In the history of the world, there is only one civilization I am aware of that was able to accomplish this.  Enter the Legend of Nephi.

So before proceeding, it is imperative to understand that your worldviews will be challenged.  To reconstruct a more accurate history of humanity, a de-mylenization process has to occur (see Guille-Barre syndrome).  Certainly my anchors of American-Judeo/Christian-Mormon systems cannot be entirely erased, but they need to be reassessed and reconstructed anchored to some fundamental truths.

Mormon is the answer and Nephi is the execution of that answer.  

Mormon is the answer.  Mormon in Egyptian means "good love" or "God love".  It also represents a place:  a mythical lake in the highlands from which we were created by God.  This is within the Egyptian tradition.  And therein, there is a lot ot unpack.  Said in a different way, using the words attributed to Timothy:  God has given us a spirt of faith (love), not fear!

Did you know Mormon meant (translated in Greco-Roman Catholic parlance) "charity: the pure love of Christ"?  Why not?  Certainly, you should know this.  Just think if we learned this simple data point 50 years ago.  Or 100 years ago.  Or in 1830 when the words first came forth.  Just Imagine!  But no, institutional friction has created a more obtuse worldview than before the Book of Mormon came forth.  Sadly.

And don't be too hard on yourself.  Mormon, the curator of Ancient American records, he himself did not know for most of his life!  Mormon as curator was preceded by Ammoron (A moron? - the heavens have a sense of humor).  Mormon tells us that he was named after his father, Mormon, who was named after the waters of Mormon where Alma converted many after being impressed by the honor of the man called Abinadi.  Mormon clearly outlines that he is a descendant of Lehi.  And at times, I wonder if he was bitter naming his son Moroni to emphasize this double entendre.  

And then in the library, he discovers a small set of plates with the first page deeply blackened (by a bitumen or black paint).  Maybe he had discovered the writings of Lehi (the large plates before).  But some of them were unlikely readable as the language had evolved (or devolved) over nearly a millenium.  Maybe the Legend of Nephi was written is a basic form.  A blue-back speller to teach his children about God while simply teaching the basics of the Egyptian language.  Or maybe the first phrase captured Mormon's attention and motivated him to more carefully study the ancient language of the people of Nephi.

The significant importances of Mormon and its meaning was likely part of the first words written by Nephi:  {a-nee} {na-fee} {a-la} {al-ma} {ee-ma} {mor-mon}!  Serving as a Rosetta Stone for Mormon, his disposition changes.  He now knows that he is a descendant of Nephi (additionally genealogical data in his extended readings?).  Now he knows where his name came from.    And what does Mormon do when he figures out what his name means?  Of course!  He writes a letter to inform his son Moroni (chapter 7).  "Hey son, I figured out what my name means!" which got Anglicized into Greco-Roman vernacular of Biblical 18th century English thanks to the scribal traditions of those that supported Joseph Smith in the translation process.

"Oh snap!  Does not compute.  You can't tell me in one breath that Mormon has a profound and consistent meaning in ancient Egyptian and that Oliver added his own flair when becoming a spokesman/scribe during the translation process!"

Yes, I can walk and chew gum.  I can dispell the tradition of my fathers (that are incorrect) while I seek truth.  Joseph Smith said we are a religion without creeds.  Oliver interrupts:  no, we need creeds.  He offers several iterations over a few years that are integral into the 13 creeds later published.  So let's say they are working on Moroni 7 and Joseph voices "Mormon means God's love or good love ..."  Will Oliver (or the current scribe at the moment) interrupt?  Will Oliver or the Whitmer's discuss this and offer their significant New Testament knowledge to enhance the translation?  Well, the answer is obvious.  If you can be self-aware to human frailties.  If Joseph was to voice a translation that was contrary to the worldviews of the scribes, would this not create problems?  Or we are supposed to believe that the scribes blindly followed Joseph and verbatim wrote every jot and tittle without interruption or challenge?  You can believe this, but it is extremely naive.  

Royal Skousen carefully suggests this reality when he says that at times "Oliver was sneaky."  I call this the Albuquerque problem.  It can be any element that contradicts the American-Judeo/Christian worldview possessed by the scribes and inner circle Joseph trusted during the translation process.  Joseph needed funds to get the book published, so would not offend others (see the lost pages events).  He likely would avoid confrontation and only would ask questions that would demonstrate how unlearned he was when talking privately with Emma (does Jerusalem have walls?).  

So now imagine Joseph voices the testimony of Jacob (Nephi's brother, 2 Nephi 9+):  "I had a dream last night and was visited by an angel (or the Lord).  He told me His name was Albuquerque."  What would the scribe say?  How would the scribe respond?  "No Joseph, His name is Jesus Christ."  

Please do not misunderstand.  I do not believe His name is Albuquerque.  Currently, I believe it was likely Yeshua.  But I have to read the translation with a knowledge of the Albuquerque problem.  Now if you go back and examine the amazing research Royal Skousen has produced, and you compare the manuscripts.  There are a collection of single words, and sometimes sentences and paragraphs that can be questioned as alterations from what Joseph initially voiced.  And if you follow the logic to the end, Royal should have called his efforts "the earliest manuscript" rather than "the earliest text".  But that articulated logic will be tabled for a moment.  We will put a pin in it.

So would your worldview be shattered if "Jesus Christ" is really "Yeshua"?  Or "Albuquerque" for that matter?  The creed about translation is too be believed when it is correct is an obvious maxim.  Scribal influence will alter any text.  The more scribes, the more changes that are likely.  Scribes will be limited in what they can alter, they cannot change the order of existing texts very easily.  But the changing of a name or number is one of the easiest alterations.

Now carefully, consider the narrative in 3 Nephi about the name of the Church.  Further consider the emphasis President Nelson has put into the NAME.  Based on Nelson's worldviews and American-Judeo/Christian-Mormon traditions, President Nelson assumes the NAME is specifically the Greco-Roman form "Jesus Christ".  I do not make this assumption for many practical considerations of language and evolution.  Therefore, I assume the NAME is important, but put a pin in it and consider it a variable.

Yes, this means I am not obeying the primary song about "following the prophet, he will not lead you astray!"  Oh no!  I am trying to develop free, independent thought.  I do not believe that a church leader immediately becomes perfect and omniscient once another church leader dies.  I respect President Nelson and his worldview.  But I can also think for myself.  I can have my own opinions.  In this regard, it is obvious:  the heavens are emphasizing that the NAME is important.  So maybe we should follow the admonition outlined in D&C 123 to seek truth. And carefully reassess what we think we know about the NAME.

What is Truth?  Is it a function of leadership of a religious institution?  So the inconsistency should be apparent.  We have a control mechanism through the institutionalization of the church and its evolutions since Joseph Smith.  The Mormon systems have articulated (mostly thanks to Brigham and his demand for loyalty) that we cannot speak "evil of the Lord's anointed".  And the social norms conclude that my intention is to do just that because I have a different opinion that President Nelson.  

The logic is flawed and nonsensical.  This would imply that Lehi would have had to receive institutional permission from Jeremiah or someone to have an opinion and voice it to the community.  Or that Samuel the Lamanite had to go to Nephi, the son of Helamen and get permission to speak his truth.  That is not how autonomy works.  That is not how God works.  There is only one Mediator.  I am free to voice my opinions however I choose.  And as Joseph made perfectly clear in his attempt to establish a church:  a school of the prophets (plural) [possibly mirroring the Essene practice associated with the scholar we know as John the Baptist] based on a reading of Revelation (spirit of prophecy is a testimony of Yeshua).  Everyone can become a prophet.  It is not a scare resource.  And maybe if we fostered this initial perspective Joseph shared, we could accelerate learning and knowledge and growth.  Maybe.

Maybe Joseph saw a future where there were hundreds if not thousands of prophets.  Imagine if we empowered the 11 million members, 6 million whom have direct genetic ties to the legend that is Nephi.  Imagine if these prophecies were shared, objectively assessed, and prophets were given a rank order NOT based on some tenure in an organizational chart; rather based on the clarity of the messages they were receiving to accelerate the restoration.  Now reflect on the marketing program Hinckley developed with the mormon.org initiative - share your "testimonies"!  Maybe he also had a partial glimpse into a future of a plethora of prophets, yet institutional friction created the paragraphs of PR statements that are boring and uninteresting.

Sometimes, I rework the standardized First Vision story.  Joseph is like:  "Hey God, should I join a church?"  God:  "Joseph, this is my Beloved Son, will you please listen to him."  Joseph:  "Yeah, sure.  But answer my question first."  Jesus:  "The churches in your area are institutions of men; that is, with their lips they do honor me, but their hearts are far from me."   Joseph:  "Does that mean no?  Maybe I can create a church like my uncle did."  Jesus:  "Sure Joseph.  You can create a church.  It will give you an opportunity to learn that the philosophies of men will mingle with scriptures and the institutional knowledge of the church will become lukewarm.  Anyway, can we get back to why I am here.   I want you to bring forth additional scripture.  In doing so, you will also learn this lesson, men will alter what I say to fit their own understanding,  ..."

Are you able to let go of the institutionalization of truths?  Are you capable of peeling back the layers of mediocrity so you can identify the essence of the innovations introduced by Joseph Smith?  Can you go back to first principles and be objective in trying to understand what Joseph, an unlearned man was trying to say while mediocre men that surrounded him (who were much more versed in Christian theological traditions) simultaneously were trying to impose their worldviews on what Joseph was seeing?  This is the challenge.

It is easy to challenge "those" Catholics or Evangelicals (out-group) for their views of papal infallacy or translation issues of the Bible.  But can we look in the mirror (in-group) and be honest?  That is the challenge, isn't it?  As Nephi taught, "a bible, a bible..."  Are you able to abstract this fundamental principle to what you consider to be American-Judeo/Christian-Mormon truth?

So would your core be shaken if Oliver fudged a few dates/numbers/times in 3 Nephi based on Masonic/Christian numerology associated with the number 33?  Or if Olivery pontificated about charity anchoring to his knowledge of the New Testament rather than focusing on the Egyptian word Mormon?  Or if Oliver instilled his Trinitarian views in 2 Nephi 32?  Or if Oliver emphasized to Josepth that he must be mistaken:  Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God, not an Ox (or Bull)!

When I raise this topic with Evangelicals and I provide a laundrey list of issues with their canon (the Bible), the authentic and faithful response can easily be:  "God is on the throne.  Every alteration was part of God's design.  God allowed them."  Amen.  So the next question is:  Why would he allow them?  To what end?  

I personally believe these are important clues (Blue's Clues).  The inconsistencies enable a restoration of the truth.  They are like markers in the path of rediscovery (33rd/34th year is a marker or a clue for something more - God allowed Oliver to manipulate the text to leave us this clue).  So can we map the pins of inconsistencies and see how they can be resolved?  

Can we use this information to update our world views?  The answer should be "certainly we can.  As long as we don't violate some core beliefs."  Okay.  Fair enough.  How about 3 Nephi about the simple doctrine:  faith, repentance, baptism by water and fire [possibly with an updated perspective on each of these].  This aligns with the simple statement about Mormon (meaning the good love).  But so what?  Let's say we gain new insights and knowledge, but it doesn't lead to new actions.  It would just be an academic exercise.  Execution requires Nephi.  Nephi built a society that represented Zion, the kingdom of heaven.  Jesus said so if you read 3 Nephi carefully!

Mormon is the answer and Nephi is the execution of that answer.  

If Enoch executed Operation Evac(uation) and Nephi executed Operation Kingdom of Heaven, what is the end of times operation.  The answer is:  Operation Save Everyone.  Following the example of Nephi and the insights of President Nelson, this task is three fold:  save everyone telestially, terrestially, and celestially.  These are steps, and order is important.  Read the last request of Nephi in 2 Nephi.  Demonstrate respect for him by carrying out his request.  Operation Save Everyone.

Nephi saved people telestially, terrestially, and celestially.  As did Enoch.  So maybe that is the essence of Zion.  

To be human is to be happy, sad, joyful, and angry.  To become celestial is to embrace all that is human, reflect on what you experience, synthesize, analyze, and then evaluate.  The anger of "we have been lied to" is as valid as the joy of learning "Nephi saved Mormon by teaching him 800 years later the true meaning of his name."  This takes us to a new place.  Not afraid of offending anyone, including God.  Maybe you are not yet ready, dear reader.  But I am.  So let's go.
