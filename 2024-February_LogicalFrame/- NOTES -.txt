In a world, [serious narrator], where A-morron commissioned Mormon to ... [shift to absurd whining by Mormon].

Mormon: our language evolved.  I can't read Egyptian.  But I translated the record of Lehi (or was it only large plates - assumptions about the lost pages, what exactly did Joseph say?).  Nephi was taught Egyptian by his mother.  Lehi was an elite who likely was a polyglot, but Lehi's (Laman's) birth language was Ancient Hebrew (Proto).

Red Frog as Bastimiento.  Tortuguero (pleasant beach conversation), water taxi delay staying in Puero Limon.  Boquete (hotsprings and cold water and beauty).

Guape as twins?  Bartholemew de las Casa: white/black brother fight after arriving by boat.  Leyenda de Yerba Mate... two men saved by a local from jaguar while trying to deliever a plant as a gift.  Zelph on Shelf funny, but in an enlarging direction.

Blue's Clues.  Dora the Explorer, Mira the Detective, [maybe Angry Birds and Daniel Tiger and Stinky/Dirty and Blaze and Paw Patrol]

Clips: Indiana Jones and Holy Grail... Is that the Ark of the Covenant... I am pretty sure ... Clips galore.

Primary efforts:  1828 dictionary, Guarani Dictionary, Budge Egyptian Dictionary, Strong's Concordance, Latin Dictionary (1502?), Luna objects (David Ramsey and Brown) [maps and texts].  Other elements such as contemporary beliefs on sexuality during Joseph Smith's time, the taboo of cutting into the body and Catholic Church competitive intelligence in the Middle Ages (the word is "suck"), mound information (Thomas narrative), the Webster Almanac, and so on.

Paranaiguara
The name means "inhabitants of the great river" in Tupi-guarani.
Parana = great river 
iguara = iguana = "big people from across the water"

Niagara ... Theories differ as to the origin of the name of the falls. The Native American word Ongiara means thundering water;[36] The New York Times used this in 1925.[37] According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the local native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area.[38] According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Onguiaahra, meaning "point of land cut in two".[39] In 1847, an Iroquois interpreter stated that the name came from Jaonniaka-re, meaning "noisy point or portage".[40] To Mohawks, the name refers to "the neck", pronounced "onyara"; the portage or neck of land between lakes Erie and Ontario onyara.[41]
