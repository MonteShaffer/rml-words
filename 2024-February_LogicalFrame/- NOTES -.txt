In a world, [serious narrator], where A-morron commissioned Mormon to ... [shift to absurd whining by Mormon].

Mormon: our language evolved.  I can't read Egyptian.  But I translated the record of Lehi (or was it only large plates - assumptions about the lost pages, what exactly did Joseph say?).  Nephi was taught Egyptian by his mother.  Lehi was an elite who likely was a polyglot, but Lehi's (Laman's) birth language was Ancient Hebrew (Proto).

Red Frog as Bastimiento.  Tortuguero (pleasant beach conversation), water taxi delay staying in Puero Limon.  Boquete (hotsprings and cold water and beauty).

Guape as twins?  Bartholemew de las Casa: white/black brother fight after arriving by boat.  Leyenda de Yerba Mate... two men saved by a local from jaguar while trying to deliever a plant as a gift.  Zelph on Shelf funny, but in an enlarging direction.

Blue's Clues.  Dora the Explorer, Mira the Detective, [maybe Angry Birds and Daniel Tiger and Stinky/Dirty and Blaze and Paw Patrol]

Clips: Indiana Jones and Holy Grail... Is that the Ark of the Covenant... I am pretty sure ... Clips galore.

Primary efforts:  1828 dictionary, Guarani Dictionary, Budge Egyptian Dictionary, Strong's Concordance, Latin Dictionary (1502?), Luna objects (David Ramsey and Brown) [maps and texts].  Other elements such as contemporary beliefs on sexuality during Joseph Smith's time, the taboo of cutting into the body and Catholic Church competitive intelligence in the Middle Ages (the word is "suck"), mound information (Thomas narrative), the Webster Almanac, and so on.
